# boot

The /boot directory contains files required for starting your system. Do I have to say this? Okay, I'll say it: DO NOT TOUCH!. If you mess up one of the files in here, you may not be able to run your Linux and it is a pain to repair. On the other hand, don't worry too much about destroying your system by accident: you have to have superuser privileges to do that.
