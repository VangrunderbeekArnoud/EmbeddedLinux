# etc

/etc is the directory where names start to get confusing. /etc gets its name from the earliest Unixes and it was literally "et cetera" because it was the dumping ground for system files administrators were not sure where else to put.

Nowadays, it would be more appropriate to say that etc stands for "Everything to configure," as it contains most, if not all system-wide configuration files. For example, the files that contain the name of your system, the users and their passwords, the names of machines on your network and when and where the partitions on your hard disks should be mounted are all in here. Again, if you are new to Linux, it may be best if you don't touch too much in here until you have a better understanding of how things work.
