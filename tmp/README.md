# tmp

/tmp contains temporary files, usually placed there by applications that you are running. The files and directories often (not always) contain data that an application doesn't need right now, but may need later on.

You can also use /tmp to store your own temporary files -- /tmp is one of the few directories hanging off / that you can actually interact with without becoming superuser.
